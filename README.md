# TaskPad


TaskPad is a user-friendly application designed to help users write and edit notes effortlessly. 
It also allows users to create daily tasks and set reminders, with timely notifications to remind them to complete tasks. When a task is finished, 
it can be marked as completed, moving it to the "completed tasks" section.

## Key Features:

- Easy Note and Task Management: Write and edit notes or tasks with a simple interface.
- Daily Task Reminders: Set a custom time for notifications to remind you of your tasks.
- Task Completion: Mark tasks as completed and manage them efficiently.

## For the TaskPad App, I used a variety of tools:

- MVVM Architecture: Ensures a clean and structured codebase.
- Cubit: For state management.
- SharedPreferences: To store user preferences locally.
- Sqflite: For local database management.
- Repository Pattern: For better data management.
- Singleton Pattern: To manage a single instance of certain classes.
- Responsive Design: Works smoothly across different devices.
- Localization: Supports both Arabic and English languages.
- Flutter Local Notifications: Provides notifications for task reminders.
- Clean Code: Ensures the project is well-structured and easy to maintain.
